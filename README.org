* Prerequisites

  Install ~wxWidgets~ (e.g. on Mac OS X ~brew install wxmac~).

* Functionality

  This program implements a rasterizer.  The rasterizer is capable of
  scan-converting polygons of any geometry, specified by their vertices
  coordinates on the canvas.  In addition, the rasterizer uses spatial
  supersampling and motion blur to reduce aliasing artifacts in space and time.

  The polygons can be drawn on the edit canvas by setting their vertices with
  mouse clicks or by holding the shift-key and mouse left button down and moving
  the mouse pointer on the edit window canvas.  The latter allows the user to
  enter curves approximated by sets of lines.

  The user interface allows the user to rotate existing polygons and scale them
  relative to the selected center point on canvas.  To select the center point
  the user clicks the left button of the mouse while holding the ctrl key down.
  After the center point is set, the user can rotate the polygon by pulling the
  polygon with mouse for one of its vertices while holding the ctrl key down.
  Or the user can scale the polygon relative to the previously selected center
  point by pulling the polygon for one of its vertices while holding the ctrl
  and shit keys down.

  The user can specify the filter kernel by typing commands in filter text box
  of the GUI.  Currently accepted commands are box, grid, random and bartlett.
  These commands determined how the supersampling will be performed.

* Implementation details

  The scan conversion, supersampling and motion blur are implemented as
  specified by an accumulation buffer algorithm.  The default filter for
  supersampling is a box on a grid of subpixels with random placement of samples
  within each individual subpixel.  Scan conversion is an implementation of the
  FvD book section 3.6 algorithm.  One notable exception is that the range of Y
  coordinates of the vertices in the current scene is determined prior to the
  edge table construction.  Then the edge table allocated to accommodate just
  for the computed range of Y coordinates. For example, if the minimum Y
  coordinate on the scene is 15 and the maximum Y coordinate is 385, then the
  edge table will have buckets 0 to 370 only.  We'll compute Y coordinate of
  each line during the line conversion by adding 15 to whatever Ymin coordinate
  we determine from the edge table.  In other words if the edge is located in
  bucket 0 of the edge table, its Ymin is 15 etc.  This works for negative
  coordinates as well.  It slows down the implementation because we need to
  reallocate the edge table before each scan-conversion run, which probably can
  be avoided.  At the same time it makes the implementation safe for any scenes,
  no matter how far beyond the canvas boundaries the scene vertices are located.

  The application was tested by running it and using different combinations of
  polygons, trying to hit all the possible corner case.  For example, by scaling
  a polygon far beyond the boundaries of the canvas, by enabling the maximum
  allowable number of AA and MB samples, by specifying different last keyframes
  for different polygons in a scene etc.

* Files

  Files in the package, what they do, and how to build them.

  - ~README.org~ (this file) Basic instructions on how to use the program.
    Describes how to add vertex points, how to render and save images, and how
    to create animations and view them.  You should definitely read this!

  - ~/src/main.cpp~ : The main module of the program that creates the GUI and
    sets up the editing and rendering canvases. You won't have to change this
    file unless you want to change the interface, which is not required for this
    assignment.

  - ~/src/canvas.cpp~, ~canvas.hpp~ : Provides you with functions that modify and read
    values from the rendering canvas.  The heart of the rendering functions for the
    program.  This is where the Rasterize() function lives, where most of your
    work will be focused.  Read the .hpp file for a detailed description of the
    provided functions.

  - ~/examples/README.samples~ : Check out this file for information on the sample
    .obs files and example results.

  - ~/docs~ : Documentation on the GLUI toolkit, if you need it.

* BUILDING THE PROGRAM

  The executable for this program is called ~rasterizer~ and it sits in the
  ~/bin~ directory of the project.  The source code you will be touching sits
  in ~/src~, and these files will be described shortly.  To build the project,
  type '~cmake . ; make~' in the top level directory.

  The program depends on OpenGL and wxWidgets (see http://wxwidgets.org/).

* How to use the GUI
** Command Line Arguments

   Start up the GUI by typing in "bin/rasterizer", located in the "bin"
   directory, with no command-line parameters.  You should be presented with an
   amazingly elegant, yet mind-blowingly functional GUI where you can specify
   polygons and how they change over time.

   One of the things that sucks about the GUI is that, in most cases, you
   won't be able to use an emulator from your dorm room or whatnot to work on
   it, because it displays OpenGL windows that most emulators don't
   support. Not to worry! If the Sweet Hall labs are crowded, or if you are
   just plain lazy, we have provided an alternative way for you to test your
   rasterizer. For this, you will need:

   one (1) .obs file

   That's it! Once you have your .obs file (we'll provide you with some, or you
   can create one with the GUI), invoke the animgui with the following
   arguments:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     rasterizer [-a<# of samples>] [-m<# of samples>] <start frame> <end frame> <input OBS file> <output label>
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   So, if we wanted to make a Tazmanian devil animation, we might do something
   like:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ rasterizer -a4 -m6 1 50 tdevil.obs tdevil
   #+END_SRC

   This would read in tdevil.obs, render frames 1 through 50 with antialiasing on
   (4 samples) and motion blurring on (6 samples), and export the lot to
   tdevil.1.ppm, tdevil.2.ppm, etc. It will also generate a tdevil.list file
   (which I'll get to in a bit).
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ rasterizer 5 5 tdevil.obs tdevil
   #+END_SRC

   Same as above, but with no antialiasing or motion blurring, and only
   rendering frame 5.
** Specifying polygons

   Shift-click on the main canvas (the Edit Window) to begin defining your
   polygon.  Additional shift-clicks will add more vertices at the specified
   locations to your polygon.  As soon as you do a normal click, you close the
   polygon and cannot add any more vertices to it (unless, of course, you want
   some extra credit).  If you only bestow 1 or 2 points unto your polygon, it
   is discarded. You can specify up to MAX_OBJECTS (defined in objects.h) on
   your canvas.

** Editing polygons

   If your polygon offends you with its bold shape and sharp corners, you can
   modify the location of any (or all) of the vertices.  Simply click (as
   opposed to shift-clicking) near the vertex you wish to move, then drag it to
   its new location.  You can also move entire polygons by right-clicking on a
   polygon vertex and dragging it around.

** Deleting polygons

   If no amount of vertex modification will improve your polygon, select it by
   clicking on one of its vertices and hit the "Del" key or the "Backspace"
   key. Both of these should cause the offending polygon to disappear forever.

** Keyframes

   A keyframe is an exact specification of a polygon at a given moment in
   time. For instance, suppose you wanted to smoothly animate a square turning
   into a house turning back into a square. You could individually animate each
   frame, incrementally changing your square to look more and more like a house
   (this is how traditional animation like Disney works), but that is a pain in
   the behind, especially if you wish to also have a life.  The computer
   animation approach is to set keyframes:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Frame 1: Polygon looks like a square
     Frame 15: Polygon looks like a house
     Frame 30: Polygon looks like a square again
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   and the computer will fill in frames 2-14 and 16-29, by doing all of the
   boring incrementing for you.

   The GUI provided allows you to easily set keyframes. Use the frame spinner
   to select which frame you wish to set a keyframe at. (WARNING: If you input
   a frame number using the text input box, be sure and press Enter to register
   the change before continuing) Then edit the object you wish to
   change. Voila! A red border appears, indicating that you have a keyframe at
   that position. Now, if you browse the frames using the spinner, you will see
   that the object is automatically interpolating between frames. By default,
   when you create an object, a keyframe is automatically created at frame 1
   with that configuration.

** Deleting Keyframes

   What could be more simple? Spin to the offending keyframe and hit "Delete
   Keyframe". The red border should go away, and any objects that had keyframes
   at that frame will lose a little piece of themselves. Note that you cannot
   delete keyframe 1; think of keyframe 1 as the "existence keyframe", without
   which objects cannot survive.

** Saving/Loading Object Files

   To save an animation you have created, type in the name ("wombat", for
   example) in the "Filename" field in the Save/Load panel and click "Save
   Objects". The GUI will create a file "wombat.obs" that holds all of your
   polygon and keyframe information. To load this file back in, type "wombat"
   in the filename field and click Load -- you don't need to add the ".obs"
   file extension.

** Rendering

   Now for the fun part. The first step is to set your antialias and motion
   blur settings. These are pretty straightforward; click the checkbox to
   enable a particular feature, then input the number of samples you want.

   To render the current frame of your animation, check the "This Frame Only"
   radio button and hit "Render". If all goes well, your newly implemented
   rasterizer should display a filled, motion-blurred, antialiased,
   museum-quality version of the pathetic line drawing in the edit canvas. If
   you put text ("kangaroo") in the "Render Out" field, a kangaroo.ppm file
   with your masterpiece will also be generated.

   To render multiple frames, check the "Multiple Frames" radio button and
   input the frame range you wish to render. In this case, you definitely
   should input text into the "Render Out" field ("images/platypus", for
   example), and the GUI will generate, in this case in the images/ directory:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     platypus.5.ppm <- frame 5
     platypus.6.ppm
     ...
     platypus.60.ppm <- frame 60
     platypus.list (more on this later)
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Warning: The .ppm files weigh in at about 700K each, so don't use up your
   quota rendering 1000 frame animations.

   Warning, part 2: Closing the Render Window will quit your program. Once it
   gets popped up, just leave it alone.

** Support Utilities

   OK, so now you have the .ppms and a .list file, so what do you do with it?
   Well, in the /usr/class/cs248/support/bin/i386-linux directory, there are
   two utilities: ppm2fli and xanim. Grab them both.

   Now, after switching to the directory with your .list file, run:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ ppm2fli tdevil.list tdevil.flc
   #+END_SRC

   This utility will take all of the ppms found in your .list file and
   compress them into an animation. After it does this, you can watch your
   animation by typing:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      $ xanim tdevil.flc
   #+END_SRC

   That should be it! Check ~objects.hpp~ for more implementation-specific
   details.
